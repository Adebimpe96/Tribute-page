      <hr><h3>My Personal Experience with Doctor</h3> <br>
      <p>Dr Abiodun was one of the lecturers assigned to my class in my HND1 level at Yaba college of Technology, He taught the course Polyfunctional Compounds and it was a very interesting one with his unique method of teaching. I fell in love with Organic chemistry more i would say..(Chuks). <br>He would give us series of Tests and class assessments just to make sure we all have a good score before the Examination. <br>Fast forward to my HND2, he taught another course Applied Spectroscopy which was another wonderful course i loved so much as an Undergraduate. <br> I would never forget to mention that he was my Project supervisor too and it was really funny how i chose his name. I was scared at first thinking it might be hard working with a disciplinarian but I would say working with him was a fantastic one. I was drilled, forced to make researches and at the end was glad I had a father as my project Supervisor. <br> The hardwork was also rewarded beautifully and i wished to have more research works with him, and that was the height of my joy</p>
